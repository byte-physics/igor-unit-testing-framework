- printFailInfo does not work with Threadsafe, therefore postponing the threadsafe version
- jump into debugger on error as option? this would require that we can tell the debugger to go back in the stack trace

be able to ignore failing test cases/suites
support for stubs and mocks?
parametric test cases?
